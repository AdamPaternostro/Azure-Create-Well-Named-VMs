# Azure-Create-Well-Named-VMs
Create a well named VNET, Subnet, NSG, Azure VMs with NICs cards and attached data disks.

This will create a VM that sorts cleanly in the Azure portal.  You avoid getting a bunch of default names that are not "clean".

You can modifiy this script to comment out the VNET creatation and just use the VM create part as well.

You can cut and paste this code directly in the Azure Bash Portal prompt, no need to install the Azure 2.0 CLI.
